            <ol>

                    The beach itself is a great place to lay back and spend the day getting a tan. It's even better for catching a couple of waves with your friends.</li>
                <li>The Huntington Beach Pier is a great place to go for a stroll with restaraunts, shops and a beautiful view. It's always relaxing walking on the pier and it can be quite romantic. </li>
                <li>Downtown Huntington still maintains that beachy vibe with great shops and restaraunts. It has awesome art around the city, tons of events, and surf city nights. </li>

            <h3>Surf Culture</h3>
            </hgroup>
            <p>Surfing, like so many outdoor pursuits, has surged during the pandemic, as more people have picked up longboards and signed up for lessons. Many of these new surfers are kids or teenagers, such as Caitlin Simmers, 16, an Oceanside, California, local who has been quickly moving up the competitive ranks of the sport.
            “During the pandemic, [surfing] was one of the only things you could do, so now there’s more people in the water,” says Caitlin’s mom, Ali Simmers.
            With sandy breaks, beachside parks, and tide pools for smaller children to explore—not to mention fewer crowds and consistent swells in the winter—Southern California is an ideal place for families to learn to surf year-round. And the presence there of a growing number of young surfers mastering the waves serves as inspiration.
